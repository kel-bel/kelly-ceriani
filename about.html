					<h1>Hello!</h1>
					<p>I’m a storyteller and I’m a designer. In any good fiction story the imagination runs wild with limitless possibilities creating a dashing hero and a conniving villain all in a world of its own. And that is what I seek to provide for my users. I believe every good webpage, app, or graphic has been crafted to tell a story about that company or product.  </p>
					<p>My story begins with me as a child never going anywhere for long without a sketchbook. (I skittered briefly from the path in high school desiring as every teen did to become a marine biologist…) My college years were dedicated to the study of architecture during which I spent a full year gallivanting throughout Europe enjoying so many of those classic history book sites. With that unique experience came the inspiration for the app noMAD which upon completion will benefit travelers all over the world. </p>
					<p>After already learning so much about user experience and web development I am constantly seeking those Everest sized challenges to help me learn even more about design and development. I am always stocked with new ideas and am geared and ready to face any villain!</p>
					<p>So even if I seem a little quiet you are forewarned my imagination is quite loud.</p>
